Here's the code for a dynamic music system for Unity. Unfortunately, the test track I was using isn't mine, so I can't share the example project here. Here's my best attempt at a quick tutorial:

Creating SongDefinition Assets:
- Right-click somewhere in your Project's "Assets/" Directory, and select DynamicMusic -> SongDefinition
- Name the file/song whatever you'd like.
- Click the Add Track button, drag in an AudioClip, and set the intensity and mood(s).

Firing up the system:
- Simply Call DynamicMusic.Play("songName") to instantiate the controller and start playing.

Composition Notes:
- Songs should be composed as looping stems that can be mixed in and out.
- The wider the variety of stems, the better the implementer can mood tag them to more closely fit different moods.

More sometime in the future...
